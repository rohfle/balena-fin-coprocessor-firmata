# BalenaFin Co-Processor Firmata [![build](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-beta-brightgreen.svg)]()

This is an implementation of the [Firmata](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) protocol for SiliconLabs BGM111. It is compatible with standard Firmata 2.5.8. Please be aware this **project is in beta release** and is subject to change frequently up until release.

### Installation

### Dockerfile

The easiest way to install the Firmata application onto your board is to run the [balena application](https://github.com/balena-io-playground/balena-fin-firmata-flash) provided. This targets the latest verision of the Balena Firmata application. This balena application will run and install [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) on your Fin in order to provision the Coprocessor with both a bootloader and the Firmata application.

### Build & Manually Flash

It is also possible to build the source and manually flash the Coprocessor however, in order to flash the Coprocessor you will need to either load the compiled firmware onto the Compute Module and flash it using OpenOCD or program the Coprocessor using an external programmer such as a [Segger JLink ](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/).

#### Dependencies

 - cmake
 - make
 - arm-none-eabi-gcc*

If using a JLink programmer to externally flash:

 - [JLink tools](https://www.segger.com/jlink-software.html)

*Make sure this is in your `$PATH`*

#### Building/Flashing

With the dependencies installed, run:

1. `make setup` to generate the build directory
2. `make balena` to execute the build

If using a JLink programmer to externally flash:

3. `make flash` to flash to a device
